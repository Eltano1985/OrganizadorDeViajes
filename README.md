# OrganizadorDeViajes

It is an interactive web travel organizer that allows the user to plan trips by selecting destinations and activities for each of those destinations.
Once the user enters a destination, a list of 15 possible activities to do is displayed from which they can only select up to 10 activities (at least one activity must be selected). All selected activities will be displayed on the interactive map.
Next, you will need to enter a possible departure and arrival date and then you can plan the trip.
When you click the plan trip button, a trip card will be displayed. It will show the destination, the start and end date of the trip, and the numbered list of the selected activities.
If the user wants to obtain more information about the destination, once entered they must click on the more information button. There you will be redirected to another page where you will see a summary of the destination (including data such as language and official currency) and a carousel of images of that destination (you will see 30 random images). If the user would like to obtain even more information about the destination, they will have a link that will redirect them to the Wikipedia page of that destination.
